      "title": "📖 Portfolio Overview: User Manual",
      "content": "### Page Overview\n\nThis is your **investment dashboard home page**, providing an at-a-glance portfolio health overview. All data is calculated in real-time by the system — no manual action required.\n\n---\n\n### 🕐 Data Update Times\n\nTwo timestamps appear at the top of the page:\n\n- **💰 Price Data Updated** — Last time stock prices were fetched via yfinance. Corresponds to market values in rebalance analysis\n- **🔍 Last Scan** — Last time the three-layer funnel scan was executed. Scans run automatically every 15 minutes\n\n> If there's a significant time gap between the two, you can trigger a manual scan from the \"Investment Radar\" page.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Portfolio Pulse (Hero Section — 3 Columns)\n\nThe hero card shows the three most critical numbers without scrolling:\n\n- **Left (wide): Total Portfolio Value** — Holdings market value in selected currency, with daily P&L (▲/▼ percentage and amount). Privacy mode masks the amount.\n- **Center: Fear & Greed Gauge** — Compact semi-circle showing the composite Fear & Greed Index (0–100). Data source priority: CNN Fear & Greed Index → VIX fallback. VIX value and CNN score shown as caption below.\n- **Right: Market Sentiment / Health Score / Tracking** — Three stacked metrics:\n  - *Market Sentiment*: Based on Trend Setter stocks vs their 60-day MA\n  - *Health Score*: % of tracked stocks with NORMAL signal (≥80% green, ≥50% yellow, <50% red)\n  - *Tracking / Holdings*: Radar-tracked count vs holdings count\n\n**Fear & Greed color bands:**\n\n| Score | Color | Level |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| 0–25 | 🟥 Deep Red | Extreme Fear |\n| 25–45 | 🟧 Orange | Fear |\n| 45–55 | 🟨 Yellow | Neutral |\n| 55–75 | 🟩 Light Green | Greed |\n| 75–100 | 🟢 Dark Green | Extreme Greed |\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Signal Alerts (Action Required)\n\nShown **before** allocation — these require your attention first.\n\nLists all tracked stocks with **non-NORMAL signals** as a table with icon, ticker, category, and signal name:\n\n| Signal | Icon | Meaning |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| `THESIS_BROKEN` | 🚨 | Moat compromised (gross margin declining significantly) |\n| `DEEP_VALUE` | 💎 | Significant undervaluation detected |\n| `OVERSOLD` | 📉 | RSI oversold |\n| `CONTRARIAN_BUY` | 🟢 | Low RSI but moat intact — possible mispriced opportunity |\n| `APPROACHING_BUY` | 🎯 | Entering accumulation zone — RSI approaching buy range |\n| `OVERHEATED` | 🔥 | High bias — stock may be short-term overheated |\n| `CAUTION_HIGH` | ⚠️ | Elevated caution |\n| `WEAKENING` | 🔻 | Momentum weakening |\n\nIf alerts exist, **rebalance suggestions** appear inline below the alert list (auto-generated add/reduce advice). If all stocks are NORMAL, a green success banner appears instead.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Allocation at a Glance (Side by Side)\n\nTwo charts displayed side by side inside a bordered card:\n\n- **Left — Dual Donut (Target vs Actual)**: Two donut charts with the same category colors. Left donut = target allocation from your investor profile; right donut = current holdings by market value. Hover for exact percentages.\n- **Right — Drift Bar Chart**: Gap between actual and target for each category (percentage points). Positive = overweight; negative = underweight. Orange dashed lines mark ±5% threshold; bars turn red when exceeded.\n\n---\n\n### 🏆 Top 10 Holdings\n\nTop 10 holdings ranked by **weight (% of total market value)**, displayed as a styled table with color-coded daily change:\n\n- **Daily Change** — Green (▲) for positive, red (▼) for negative, from yfinance historical data\n- **Privacy Mode** — Market value column is masked as `***`; daily change percentage still shows\n\n> 💡 If a single holding exceeds 15% weight, watch for concentration risk. Visit the Asset Allocation page's X-Ray analysis for detailed exposure.\n>\n> ⚠️ **Note**: Daily change requires at least 2 days of history. Newly added stocks show `N/A`.\n\n---\n\n### 🏦 Smart Money Resonance\n\nShows which of your watchlist/holdings overlap with top institutional investors' 13F filings.\n\n- **3 KPI metrics always visible**: Overlapping stock count, number of gurus with overlap, strongest resonance signal\n- **Expand \"📋 Top 5 Resonance Details\"** to see per-stock guru cards (collapsed by default to save space)\n- **\"View Smart Money\" button** in the section header links directly to the full Smart Money page\n\n> ⚠️ Based on quarterly 13F snapshots — not real-time data.\n\n---\n\n### 🙈 Privacy Mode (Cross-Device Sync)\n\nThe privacy toggle in the title row masks all **monetary amounts** (total value, holding values), keeping only percentages and category structure. The setting is saved to the database and syncs across devices and sessions. Can also be toggled from the Asset Allocation page — both pages stay in sync."

      "content": "### System Overview\n\nThe system classifies assets into **five categories**, each with different tracking logic:\n\n| Category | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| 🌊 **Trend Setter** | Large-cap ETFs and mega-caps — tracks capital flow and Capex |\n| 🏰 **Moat** | Irreplaceable pick-and-shovel companies in the supply chain |\n| 🚀 **Growth** | High-volatility stocks with significant upside potential |\n| 🛡️ **Bond** | Government bonds & investment-grade bond ETFs (e.g., TLT, BND, SGOV) |\n| 💵 **Cash** | Idle cash (USD, TWD, JPY) — managed on the Asset Allocation page |\n\n> 💡 The system has two main pages: **Investment Radar** (this page) for stock tracking and scanning, and **Asset Allocation** for cash management, holdings, and rebalance analysis. Switch between them using the sidebar navigation.\n\n---\n\n### Workflow\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Check the Weather — Click \"🚀 Run Scan\"\n\nWhen the page loads, a **loading indicator** appears at the top (📡 Loading stock data...), collapsing to \"✅ Loaded N stocks\" when complete.\n\nClick the scan button in the left panel. The system runs a **V2 Three-Layer Funnel Analysis** in the background (parallel scanning 4 stocks, ~30 seconds). The system also auto-scans every 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, observe **Layer 1 — Market Sentiment**:\n\n| Signal | % Below 60MA | Meaning | Suggestion |\n|--------|:---:|---------|------------|\n| ☀️ **Sunny** (Strong Bullish) | 0–10% | Nearly all trend setters above 60MA | Full risk-on — great conditions |\n| 🌤️ **Mostly Sunny** (Bullish) | 10–30% | Normal healthy breadth | Standard position sizing |\n| ⛅ **Partly Cloudy** (Neutral) | 30–50% | Mixed signals, transition zone | Reduce new entries, be selective |\n| 🌧️ **Rainy** (Bearish) | 50–70% | Majority weakening | Defensive — scale down exposure |\n| ⛈️ **Stormy** (Strong Bearish) | >70% | Extreme breadth weakness | Maximum caution — look for contrarian opportunities |\n\n> **Note**: ETFs (e.g., VTI, VT) are excluded from market sentiment calculation because they ARE the market, which would create circular reasoning. Only individual stocks serve as trend setters.\n\nScan results are pushed via **Telegram differential notifications** — you only receive notifications when signals **change**, avoiding duplicate alerts.\n\nAlso monitor the **Fear & Greed Index** (on the Dashboard KPI area):\n\n| Level | Score Range | Suggestion |\n|-------|-------------|------------|\n| 😱 **Extreme Fear** | 0–25 | \"Be greedy when others are fearful\" — actively seek mispriced opportunities |\n| 😨 **Fear** | 25–45 | Market bearish — scale in gradually, don't go all-in |\n| 😐 **Neutral** | 45–55 | Wait and watch, wait for clarity |\n| 🤑 **Greed** | 55–75 | Market bullish — watch for overheating |\n| 🤯 **Extreme Greed** | 75–100 | \"Be fearful when others are greedy\" — consider taking profits |\n\n> The Fear & Greed Index combines **VIX volatility** and **CNN Fear & Greed Index**, updated every 15 minutes.\n\n> 💡 This step determines your \"position size\" — don't sail out in bad weather.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Check the Moat — Open the 🏰 Moat Tab\n\nExpand a stock card, then click the **🏰 Moat** tab. It contains:\n- **Gross Margin Metrics**: Latest gross margin + YoY change (percentage points)\n- **5-Quarter Trend Chart**: Line chart showing gross margin trajectory\n- **Five-Level Auto Diagnosis**:\n  - 🔴 **Thesis Broken** — Gross margin YoY decline >2pp, moat compromised — don't catch falling knives\n  - 🟢 **Mispriced Opportunity** — Price pulled back (bias < -5%) but gross margin growing — strong fundamentals\n  - 🟢 **Moat Intact** — Gross margin YoY growth — healthy fundamentals\n  - 🟡 **Price Weakening** — Bias low but moat data flat — watch next quarter\n  - ⚪ **Monitoring** — Moat data flat — continue observing\n\n> 💡 A falling stock price isn't scary — what's scary is when fundamentals fall too. Gross margin is the most direct moat indicator.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Read the Signals — Open the 📈 Scan History Tab\n\nAfter scanning, the system generates a decision signal for each stock. Expand a card and click the **📈 Scan History** tab to view the last 10 scan results and **consecutive anomaly count**:\n\n| Signal | Trigger Condition | Action |\n|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| 💎 **DEEP_VALUE** | Bias < −20% AND RSI < 35 (category-adjusted) | Highest-conviction entry — both indicators confirm deep discount |\n| 📉 **OVERSOLD** | Bias < −20% (RSI ≥ 35) | Price deeply discounted — wait for RSI confirmation before acting |\n| 🟢 **CONTRARIAN_BUY** | RSI < 35 (category-adjusted) | RSI oversold — dip your toes, scale in gradually |\n| 🎯 **APPROACHING_BUY** | RSI < 37 (category-adjusted) + Bias < −15% | Accumulation zone — start watching closely |\n| 🔥 **OVERHEATED** | Bias > 20% AND RSI > 70 | Both indicators overheated — don't chase, consider trimming |\n| ⚠️ **CAUTION_HIGH** | Bias > 20% OR RSI > 70 | Single indicator elevated — reduce new positions, tighten stops |\n| 🔻 **WEAKENING** | Bias < −15% AND RSI < 38 | Early weakness detected — monitor closely |\n| 🚨 **THESIS_BROKEN** | Gross margin YoY decline > 2 percentage points | Fundamentals deteriorating — consider stop-loss |\n| ➖ **NORMAL** | No anomalies | Continue monitoring |\n| 🌊 **ROGUE WAVE** | Bias ≥ 95th percentile + volume ratio ≥ 1.5x | Party likely peaking — no leveraged chasing, consider reducing exposure |\n\n> 💡 \"Don't fall in love with a stock\" — when Thesis Broken appears, execute stop-loss decisively.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Set Price Alerts — Open the 🔔 Price Alerts Tab\n\nExpand a card and click the **🔔 Price Alerts** tab to:\n- **Create custom alerts**: Choose metric (RSI / Price / Bias), condition (< or >), and threshold\n- **View existing alerts**: See all configured alerts and trigger history\n- **Delete alerts**: One-click removal when no longer needed\n\nAlerts trigger via **Telegram instant notifications**, with a **4-hour cooldown** to prevent spam.\n\n> 💡 Use conditions like RSI < 30 or Bias < -20% to let the system watch the market for you.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Track Institutional Moves — Open the 🐳 Chips Tab\n\nExpand a card and click the **🐳 Chips (13F)** tab. It provides:\n- **WhaleWisdom link**: One-click access to full 13F institutional holdings report\n- **Top 5 Institutional Holders**: Displayed as a table when available\n- Key observations:\n  - **New / Add** → Institutions are accumulating\n  - **Reduce / Sold Out** → Institutions are exiting\n\n> 💡 Follow \"new positions\", not existing inventory. Watch benchmark institutions like Berkshire, Bridgewater, Renaissance.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Check Earnings & Dividends — Open the 📊 Metrics Tab\n\nExpand a card and click the **📊 Metrics** tab. At the bottom you will find:\n- **📅 Earnings Date**: Next earnings release date, with countdown when within 14 days\n- **💰 Dividend Yield** (Moat/Bond categories): Current dividend yield and ex-dividend date\n\n> 💡 Earnings season is the critical moment when your moat thesis gets validated — prepare in advance.\n\n---\n\n#### Stock Card Information\n\nEach stock card header shows:\n\n`📉 NVDA — 🌊 Trend Setter | $120.5 (▲1.2%) | 🇺🇸 US | Oversold`\n\n- **Signal Icon** (🟢🔥🚨➖…) — Live signal computed from real-time RSI and bias (not the last manual scan)\n- **Ticker** — e.g., NVDA, 2330.TW\n- **Category** — Trend Setter / Moat / Growth / Bond\n- **Price & Change** — Latest price with daily change percentage\n- **Market Flag** — 🇺🇸 US / 🇹🇼 TW / 🇯🇵 JP / 🇭🇰 HK (auto-detected from ticker suffix)\n- **Signal Label** — Human-readable signal name when non-NORMAL (e.g., Oversold, Overheated)\n\nWhen expanded, the card has two tiers:\n\n**Tier 1 — At-a-Glance** (always visible):\n- Signal summary bar: RSI · Bias · Volume Ratio chips with color-coded emoji\n- Current investment thesis\n- Price trend chart\n- Tags\n\n**Tier 2 — Detail Tabs**:\n- **📊 Metrics** — Full indicators (RSI, MA200, MA60, Bias, Volume Ratio), earnings date, dividend yield, guru resonance\n- **🏰 Moat** — Gross margin trend and moat diagnosis (Trend Setter / Moat / Growth only)\n- **📈 Scan History** — Last 10 scan results with signal icons\n- **🐳 Chips (13F)** — Institutional holdings and WhaleWisdom link\n- **🔔 Price Alerts** — Configure and manage price/RSI/bias alerts\n- **📝 Thesis Versioning** — Full thesis history with version numbers\n- **🔄 Change Category** — Switch the stock to a different category\n- **🗑️ Remove** — Remove from watchlist (requires reason)\n\nThe **📊 Metrics** tab also shows **🕐 Data Updated** time (auto-converted to your browser's local timezone).\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Record Your Thesis — Open the 📝 Thesis Versioning Tab\n\nInvestment decisions need documentation to avoid hindsight bias:\n- Expand a card and click **📝 Thesis Versioning** to view **complete thesis history** (with version numbers and dates)\n- Each update auto-increments the version (v1 → v2 → v3...)\n- **Tags** (AI, Cloud, SaaS...) are versioned alongside the thesis\n\n> 💡 Regularly review your thesis evolution to discover blind spots and track your growth.\n\n---\n\n#### Market Filter Pills (Multi-Market Portfolios)\n\nWhen your watchlist includes stocks from multiple markets (e.g., US + JP), **market filter pills** (ALL / US / JP / TW / HK) automatically appear above the category tabs. Click any market to show only that market's stocks; click \"ALL\" to restore the full view. Market labels are auto-detected from ticker suffixes (`.T` = 🇯🇵 JP, `.TW` = 🇹🇼 TW, `.HK` = 🇭🇰 HK, others = 🇺🇸 US).\n\n---\n\n#### 8. Manage Watchlist — Sort, Categorize, Export, Import\n\n- **↕️ Drag to Reorder**: Check \"↕️ Drag to Reorder\" at the top of each tab, drag to rearrange, then click \"💾 Save Order\"\n- **🔄 Change Category**: Open the **🔄 Change Category** tab inside a card to switch categories (e.g., Trend Setter → Moat)\n- **🗑️ Remove**: Open the **🗑️ Remove** tab — requires a reason; removed stocks appear in the \"📦 Removed\" tab\n- **🔄 Reactivate**: In the \"📦 Removed\" tab, reactivate stocks to any category\n- **📥 Export Watchlist**: Download JSON of your complete watchlist (with thesis and tags) from the left panel\n- **📤 Import Watchlist**: Upload JSON for batch import (supports upsert) from the left panel\n\n---\n\n#### 9. Weekly Digest\n\nEvery Sunday at 18:00 UTC, the system sends a **Telegram portfolio health report** containing:\n- **Health Score**: Percentage of stocks with normal signals (e.g., 85%)\n- **Anomaly List**: Stocks currently not NORMAL and their signals\n- **Weekly Signal Changes**: Stocks with signal changes in the past 7 days and change counts\n\n> 💡 Spend 5 minutes reviewing the weekly digest to stay on top of your portfolio."

      "content": "### Page Overview\n\nThis page handles **personal asset holdings management** and **portfolio rebalance analysis**. Switch from Investment Radar via the sidebar navigation.\n\n### 🙈 Privacy Mode (Cross-Device Sync)\n\nThe **privacy mode toggle** in the top-right corner masks all sensitive monetary figures (total value, holding quantities, prices, cost basis, market value) with `***`, keeping only percentages and category structure. Ideal for screen sharing or screenshots — backend data is not affected. **Privacy mode is saved to the database** and syncs across devices and browser sessions. Can also be toggled from the Portfolio Overview page — both pages stay in sync.\n\n---\n\n### Sidebar — Add Holdings (Three Modes)\n\nSwitch between three holding types via \"Asset Type\":\n\n- **📈 Stock**: Select market (🇺🇸 US / 🇹🇼 TW / 🇯🇵 JP / 🇭🇰 HK), enter ticker (system auto-appends suffix like `.TW`, `.T`), select category, enter shares, cost basis, and broker\n- **🛡️ Bond**: Enter bond ticker (e.g., TLT, BND), select currency, enter shares, cost basis, and broker\n- **💵 Cash**: Select currency and amount, optionally add bank, account type (savings/time deposit/money market fund), and notes\n\n#### Radar Auto-Sync\n\n- If the ticker is **already tracked in Radar**, the category field auto-populates from Radar (locked, not editable)\n- If it's a **new ticker**, the system automatically adds it to Radar tracking after creating the holding — you can optionally add an initial thesis\n\nThe sidebar also provides **Export / Import holdings** (JSON format) and import template download.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1 — Set Target Allocation (Collapsible)\n\n- Choose from 6 preset **investor profile templates** (Retirement Defense, Standard, Aggressive, Barbell, Sniper, Custom)\n- Each template has default target ratios for five categories\n- **Fine-tune** category percentages anytime (must total 100%)\n- After selecting a template, click **\"🔄 Switch Style\"** to change to another\n- Once set, this section auto-collapses — click to expand and edit\n\n---\n\n### Step 2 — Holdings Management\n\n- Holdings table supports **inline editing**: click cells to modify quantity, cost basis, broker, category\n- Click \"💾 Save Changes\" to batch-update after editing\n- Select a holding from the dropdown and click \"🗑️ Delete\" to remove\n- Add new holdings via the sidebar\n\n---\n\n### Analysis Tabs (Rebalance / Currency Exposure / Smart Withdrawal / Stress Test)\n\nAfter completing Steps 1 & 2, the four analysis tabs (📊 Rebalance, 💱 Currency Exposure, 💰 Smart Withdrawal, 🧪 Stress Test) become available. The \"⚙️ Settings\" tab has a shared **display currency selector** and **🔄 Refresh** button — switching currency or refreshing applies to all analysis tabs.\n\n#### 📊 Rebalance Analysis\n\n- **Loading Indicator**: Shows \"📊 Loading rebalance analysis...\" animation while loading, auto-collapses to \"✅ Rebalance analysis loaded\"\n- **Data Update Time**: Shows data fetch time (🕐), auto-detects browser timezone for local time display\n- **Live Exchange Rates**: System fetches real-time rates via yfinance (1-hour cache) for accurate cross-currency conversion\n- **Dual Pie Charts**: Target allocation vs actual allocation\n- **Drift Bar Chart**: Deviation per category (red = overweight / green = underweight)\n- **Holdings Detail**: Shows each stock's original currency, quantity, price, cost basis, converted market value, and weight; non-USD holdings additionally display **Home Return** (local price return + FX impact) and **FX Return** (purchase FX rate snapshot vs current rate)\n- **Rebalance Suggestions**: Auto-flags categories drifting >5%, with add/reduce recommendations\n- **🔬 X-Ray Analysis**: Auto-parses ETF top 10 holdings, calculates \"direct holdings + indirect ETF exposure\" true ratios. Stacked bar chart shows concentration risk; orange warnings at >15% threshold; one-click Telegram alert\n\n> 💡 Periodically (e.g., quarterly) reviewing asset allocation is the most important — yet most neglected — investment discipline.\n\n#### 💱 Currency Exposure Monitor\n\n- **Home Currency Setting**: Switch home currency in the top-right (e.g., TWD → USD) — used as the FX exposure baseline\n- **Dual Tabs**:\n  - **💵 Cash Currency Exposure** (default): Analyzes only cash position currency distribution — FX risk impacts cash most directly\n  - **📊 Full Asset Currency Exposure**: Analyzes entire portfolio (stocks, bonds, cash) currency distribution\n- **Currency Distribution Pie**: Donut chart showing market value proportion per currency\n- **Risk Level**: Auto-determined by FX alert severity\n  - 🟢 Low Risk: No significant FX alerts\n  - 🟡 Medium Risk: Short-term (5-day) swing detected\n  - 🔴 High Risk: Single-day extreme movement detected\n- **Recent FX Changes**: Shows 5-day FX rate change for each foreign currency vs home currency, with 📈📉 direction indicators\n- **FX Alerts**: Three-tier detection (🔴 1-day >1.5% / 🟡 5-day >2% / 🔵 3-month >8%), color-coded\n- **Smart Advice**: System highlights cash position exposure amounts needing attention\n- **Telegram Alerts**: Sent when FX changes exceed thresholds (including cash exposure amounts). Auto-checks every 6 hours; manual trigger via \"📨 Send FX Exposure Alert to Telegram\"\n\n#### 💰 Smart Withdrawal\n\nWhen you need to withdraw cash from your portfolio, the system uses a **Liquidity Waterfall** three-tier priority algorithm to suggest the optimal sell plan:\n\n1. **🔄 Rebalance** (Priority 1): Sell overweight assets first — simultaneously returning to target allocation\n2. **📉 Tax Harvesting** (Priority 2): Sell positions at a loss for Tax-Loss Harvesting\n3. **💧 Liquidity** (Priority 3): Sell by liquidity order (Cash → Bond → Growth → Moat → Trend Setter)\n\n- Enter **withdrawal amount** and **currency**, click \"💰 Calculate Withdrawal Plan\"\n- System shows sell recommendations table (ticker, quantity, amount, reason) and summary metrics (target, sellable total, shortfall)\n- If portfolio value is insufficient, a **shortfall warning** appears\n- Optionally enable \"📡 Send Telegram Notification\" to sync recommendations to Telegram\n\n> 💡 Smart Withdrawal's core principle: sell what should be sold first (overweight), then what saves taxes (losses), and only then tap liquid assets — protecting your compounding core holdings.\n\n#### 🧪 Stress Test\n\nSimulates market crash scenarios to test your portfolio's resilience. Based on linear CAPM model (β values) to estimate expected losses during market downturns.\n\n- **Crash Scenario Slider**: Select market decline (-50% to 0%) to simulate S&P 500-like crashes\n- **Portfolio Weighted Beta**: Overall Beta value (Beta > 1.0 = more volatile than market; Beta < 1.0 = more stable)\n- **Expected Loss Amount**: Shows projected portfolio loss amount and percentage under the scenario\n- **Pain Levels**:\n  - 🟢 Gentle Breeze (< 10% loss)\n  - 🟡 Noticeable Correction (10–20% loss)\n  - 🟠 Significant Damage (20–30% loss)\n  - 🔴 Sleepless Nights (≥ 30% loss)\n- **Holdings Breakdown**: Per-stock expected loss detail, sorted by impact\n- **Smart Advice**: At \"Sleepless Nights\" level, system provides risk management suggestions (review Beta, emergency fund, leverage risk, etc.)\n- **Privacy Mode**: Supports amount masking — only percentages and levels shown\n\n> 💡 Stress testing helps you assess portfolio resilience and understand extreme-scenario risk exposure. Regularly reviewing Beta and expected losses is a key part of risk management.\n\n---\n\n### Telegram Settings (Dual Mode)\n\n- **System Default Bot**: Uses `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env` — no additional setup needed\n- **Custom Bot**: Enter custom Bot Token and Chat ID, toggle \"Use Custom Bot\"\n- With custom bot enabled, all scan notifications, price alerts, and weekly digests go through your custom bot\n- When custom bot is disabled/not set, automatically falls back to system default bot\n- **Test Button**: After saving, click \"📨 Send Test Message\" to verify the setup\n- **Weekly Digest**: Click \"📬 Send Weekly Digest\" to manually trigger the portfolio health report (runs in background, results sent via Telegram)"

Add Monitoring Configuration\n\nClick the \"➕ Add\" button in the top right, and configure the following parameters:\n\n- **Base Currency / Quote Currency**: Select the currency pair to monitor (e.g., USD/TWD = US Dollar to Taiwan Dollar)\n- **Recent High Lookback Days**: How many days back the system checks to determine the \"high\" (recommended: 30 days)\n- **Consecutive Rise Days Threshold**: How many consecutive rising days trigger an alert (recommended: 3 days)\n- **Enable Alert Types**: Select one or both (at least one required)\n- **Reminder Interval**: No repeat alerts for the same configuration within this time (avoid spam)\n\n#### 2. View Monitoring Status\n\nKPI area displays:\n- **Total Monitors** — Number of configured currency pairs\n- **Active** — Number of currently enabled monitors\n- **Last Alert** — Timestamp of the most recent alert sent\n\n#### 3. Manual Check & Test\n\n- **🔍 Check**: Immediately analyze all monitors without sending notifications (check current status)\n- **📨 Alert**: Manually trigger Telegram notification (subject to reminder interval limits)\n\n#### 4. Expand Monitor Card\n\nClick any currency pair card to view:\n\n- **📈 Rate Trend Chart**: 3-month historical data, switchable 1M/2M/3M display period, orange dashed line indicates \"recent high\" reference\n- **📊 Analysis Reasoning**: System's rationale for whether to alert (e.g., \"Approaching 30-day high\", \"3 consecutive days rising\")\n- **⚙️ Monitor Settings**: Current configuration details and last alert timestamp\n\n#### 5. Edit / Disable / Delete\n\n- **⚙️ Edit**: Modify monitor parameters (recent high days, consecutive rise threshold, alert toggles, reminder interval)\n- **🔴 Disable / 🟢 Enable**: Temporarily pause or resume monitoring\n- **🗑️ Delete**: Remove monitor configuration\n\n---\n\n### Automatic Scan Mechanism\n\nThe system automatically runs FX monitoring scan every **6 hours** (triggered by Scanner container's Cron Job), sending Telegram notifications when conditions are met.\n\n---\n\n### 🔒 Privacy Mode\n\nEnabling Privacy Mode (top-right toggle) hides charts and analysis content, showing only monitor configurations.",

      "content": "### What is Smart Money Tracker?\n\n**Smart Money** tracks SEC **13F quarterly filings** from top institutional investors — Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffett), Bridgewater (Ray Dalio), Renaissance Technologies, and more. It surfaces stocks where guru portfolios overlap with your own watchlist or holdings.\n\n> ⚠️ **Important**: 13F filings are quarterly snapshots with a 45-day filing deadline. Holdings may lag reality by **45–90 days** and do not reflect current positions. Do not use as real-time trading signals.\n\n---\n\n### Workflow\n\n#### 1. Add a Guru\n\nExpand **\"➕ Add Custom Guru\"** in the sidebar and fill in:\n- **Institution Full Name**: Exact name as listed on SEC EDGAR (e.g. `Berkshire Hathaway Inc`)\n- **SEC CIK Code**: 10-digit identifier — look it up at SEC EDGAR\n- **Display Name**: Your friendly label (e.g. `Warren Buffett`)\n\nSeveral well-known gurus are pre-loaded and ready to use.\n\n#### 2. Sync Latest 13F\n\nSelect a guru, then click **\"🔄 Sync Latest 13F\"** to fetch the latest filing from SEC EDGAR.\n\n- ✅ **Sync complete**: New data was fetched and saved\n- ℹ️ **Already up to date**: No new data since last sync\n\n> 💡 During filing seasons (February, May, August, November), the cron service syncs automatically every day; off-season it runs weekly — no manual action needed.\n\n#### 3. Holding Changes (Tab 1)\n\n| Action | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| 🟢 **New Position** | Opened this quarter |\n| 🔴 **Sold Out** | Fully exited this quarter |\n| 📈 **Increased** | Added shares this quarter |\n| 📉 **Decreased** | Reduced shares this quarter |\n\n> 💡 Focus on **New Positions** — a fresh allocation is usually a stronger conviction signal than adding to an existing position.\n\n#### 4. Top 10 Holdings (Tab 2)\n\nHorizontal bar chart shows portfolio weight with action-colored bars. The detail table below shows rank, action badge, value, and share count.\n\n#### 5. Great Minds Think Alike (Tab 3)\n\nAutomatically compares **all tracked gurus** against your watchlist / holdings to find overlapping stocks. The resonance badge (🏆×N) also appears on stock cards in the **Investment Radar** page so you can spot guru alignment at a glance."
