      "content": "### Page Overview\n\nThis is your **investment dashboard home page**, providing an at-a-glance portfolio health overview. All data is calculated in real-time by the system — no manual action required.\n\n---\n\n### 🕐 Data Update Times\n\nTwo timestamps appear at the top of the page:\n\n- **💰 Price Data Updated** — Last time stock prices were fetched via yfinance. Corresponds to market values in rebalance analysis\n- **🔍 Last Scan** — Last time the three-layer funnel scan was executed. Scans run automatically every 30 minutes\n\n> If there's a significant time gap between the two, you can trigger a manual scan from the \"Investment Radar\" page.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Fear & Greed Index (Semi-Circle Gauge)\n\nThe semi-circle gauge above the KPI row shows the **composite Fear & Greed Index** (0–100).\n\n**Data Sources (priority order):**\n- **CNN Fear & Greed Index (primary)** — CNN's composite of 7 market indicators (including VIX), used directly as the score\n- **VIX (fallback)** — Only used when CNN is unavailable; VIX is converted to a score. A warning appears below the gauge\n\n**Color Band Meaning (left to right):**\n\n| Score Range | Color | Level |\n|-------------|-------|-------|\n| 0–25 | 🟥 Deep Red | Extreme Fear |\n| 25–45 | 🟧 Orange | Fear |\n| 45–55 | 🟨 Yellow | Neutral |\n| 55–75 | 🟩 Light Green | Greed |\n| 75–100 | 🟢 Dark Green | Extreme Greed |\n\n**How to read:** The needle position indicates current market sentiment. VIX value, daily change, and CNN score (when available) are shown below the gauge.\n\n---\n\n### KPI Row (Four Cards)\n\n| Metric | Description | How to Read |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Market Sentiment** | Based on whether Trend Setter stocks are below their 60-day MA | ☀️ Sunny = Most trend setters above MA, market bullish; 🌧️ Rainy = Majority below, market bearish |\n| **Total Market Value** | Sum of all holdings (in selected currency), with daily change | Shows daily change percentage and amount (▲ up / ▼ down). Privacy mode shows only percentage, amounts masked as `***`. Currency can be switched via the dropdown |\n| **Health Score** | Percentage of tracked stocks with \"NORMAL\" signal | ≥ 80% green (healthy), ≥ 50% yellow (caution), < 50% red (alert). Shows normal count / total count |\n| **Tracked / Holdings** | Number of radar-tracked stocks vs actual holdings | Large gap means some tracked stocks lack holdings, or holdings exist without radar tracking |\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Target vs Actual Allocation (Dual Pie Charts)\n\nTwo donut charts side by side: **left is target allocation** (your ideal ratios from investor profile), **right is actual allocation** (current holdings by market value). Both use the same category colors for easy visual comparison.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Drift (Bar Chart)\n\nShows the **gap between actual and target allocation** for each category (in percentage points).\n\n- **Positive** (upward) = Overweight — category exceeds target\n- **Negative** (downward) = Underweight — category below target\n- Orange dashed line marks **±5%** threshold; bars turn red when exceeded\n- Expand \"💡 Rebalance Suggestions\" for auto-generated add/reduce recommendations\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Signal Alerts\n\nLists all tracked stocks with **non-NORMAL signals**:\n\n| Signal | Icon | Meaning |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| `THESIS_BROKEN` | 🔴 | Moat compromised (gross margin declining significantly) |\n| `CONTRARIAN_BUY` | 🟢 | Low RSI but moat intact — possible mispriced opportunity |\n| `OVERHEATED` | 🟠 | High bias — stock may be short-term overheated |\n\nIf all stocks are NORMAL, a green \"✅ All tracked stocks have normal signals!\" message appears.\n\n---\n\n### 🏆 Top 10 Holdings\n\nTop 10 holdings ranked by **weight (% of total market value)**, showing ticker, category, weight percentage, market value, and daily change.\n\n- **Daily Change** — Shows individual stock change vs previous trading day (▲ up / ▼ down), from yfinance historical data\n- **Privacy Mode** — Market value is masked as `***`, but daily change percentage still shows\n\n> 💡 If a single holding exceeds 15% weight, watch for concentration risk. Visit the Asset Allocation page's X-Ray analysis for detailed exposure.\n>\n> ⚠️ **Note**: Daily change data requires at least 2 days of history. Newly added stocks or those with insufficient data will show `N/A`.\n\n---\n\n### 🙈 Privacy Mode (Cross-Device Sync)\n\nThe privacy toggle in the top-right corner masks all **monetary amounts** (total value, holding values), keeping only percentages and category structure. The setting is saved to the database and syncs across devices and sessions. Can also be toggled from the Asset Allocation page — both pages stay in sync."

      "content": "### System Overview\n\nThe system classifies assets into **five categories**, each with different tracking logic:\n\n| Category | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| 🌊 **Trend Setter** | Large-cap ETFs and mega-caps — tracks capital flow and Capex |\n| 🏰 **Moat** | Irreplaceable pick-and-shovel companies in the supply chain |\n| 🚀 **Growth** | High-volatility stocks with significant upside potential |\n| 🛡️ **Bond** | Government bonds & investment-grade bond ETFs (e.g., TLT, BND, SGOV) |\n| 💵 **Cash** | Idle cash (USD, TWD, JPY) — managed on the Asset Allocation page |\n\n> 💡 The system has two main pages: **Investment Radar** (this page) for stock tracking and scanning, and **Asset Allocation** for cash management, holdings, and rebalance analysis. Switch between them using the sidebar navigation.\n\n---\n\n### Workflow\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Check the Weather — Click \"🚀 Run Scan\"\n\nWhen the page loads, a **loading indicator** appears at the top (📡 Loading stock data...), collapsing to \"✅ Loaded N stocks\" when complete.\n\nClick the scan button in the left panel. The system runs a **V2 Three-Layer Funnel Analysis** in the background (parallel scanning 4 stocks, ~30 seconds). The system also auto-scans every 30 minutes.\n\nFirst, observe **Layer 1 — Market Sentiment**:\n\n| Signal | Meaning | Suggestion |\n|--------|---------|------------|\n| 🟢 **POSITIVE (Sunny)** | Trend setter stocks are healthy, capital flow is normal | Good time to look for individual stock entries |\n| 🔴 **CAUTION (Rainy)** | Trend setters weakening (>50% below 60MA), market risk rising | Recommend staying on the sidelines |\n\n> **Note**: ETFs (e.g., VTI, VT) are excluded from market sentiment calculation because they ARE the market, which would create circular reasoning. Only individual stocks serve as trend setters.\n\nScan results are pushed via **Telegram differential notifications** — you only receive notifications when signals **change**, avoiding duplicate alerts.\n\nAlso monitor the **Fear & Greed Index** (on the Dashboard KPI area):\n\n| Level | Score Range | Suggestion |\n|-------|-------------|------------|\n| 😱 **Extreme Fear** | 0–25 | \"Be greedy when others are fearful\" — actively seek mispriced opportunities |\n| 😨 **Fear** | 25–45 | Market bearish — scale in gradually, don't go all-in |\n| 😐 **Neutral** | 45–55 | Wait and watch, wait for clarity |\n| 🤑 **Greed** | 55–75 | Market bullish — watch for overheating |\n| 🤯 **Extreme Greed** | 75–100 | \"Be fearful when others are greedy\" — consider taking profits |\n\n> The Fear & Greed Index combines **VIX volatility** and **CNN Fear & Greed Index**, updated every 30 minutes.\n\n> 💡 This step determines your \"position size\" — don't sail out in bad weather.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Check the Moat — Expand \"🏰 Moat Analysis\"\n\nEach stock card has a \"🏰 Moat Analysis\" expandable section containing:\n- **Gross Margin Metrics**: Latest gross margin + YoY change (percentage points)\n- **5-Quarter Trend Chart**: Line chart showing gross margin trajectory\n- **Five-Level Auto Diagnosis**:\n  - 🔴 **Thesis Broken** — Gross margin YoY decline >2pp, moat compromised — don't catch falling knives\n  - 🟢 **Mispriced Opportunity** — Price pulled back (bias < -5%) but gross margin growing — strong fundamentals\n  - 🟢 **Moat Intact** — Gross margin YoY growth — healthy fundamentals\n  - 🟡 **Price Weakening** — Bias low but moat data flat — watch next quarter\n  - ⚪ **Monitoring** — Moat data flat — continue observing\n\n> 💡 A falling stock price isn't scary — what's scary is when fundamentals fall too. Gross margin is the most direct moat indicator.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Read the Signals — View Scan History\n\nAfter scanning, the system generates a decision signal for each stock. Expand \"📈 Scan History\" to view the last 10 scan results and **consecutive anomaly count**:\n\n| Signal | Trigger Condition | Action |\n|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| 🟢 **CONTRARIAN_BUY** | RSI < 35 + Positive market sentiment + Moat intact | Dip your toes — scale in gradually |\n| 🟡 **OVERHEATED** | Bias > 20% | Overheated signal — don't chase |\n| 🔴 **THESIS_BROKEN** | Gross margin YoY decline > 2 percentage points | Fundamentals deteriorating — consider stop-loss |\n| ⚪ **NORMAL** | No anomalies | Continue monitoring |\n\n> 💡 \"Don't fall in love with a stock\" — when Thesis Broken appears, execute stop-loss decisively.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Set Price Alerts — Expand \"🔔 Price Alerts\"\n\nEach stock card's \"🔔 Price Alerts\" section allows you to:\n- **Create custom alerts**: Choose metric (RSI / Price / Bias), condition (< or >), and threshold\n- **View existing alerts**: See all configured alerts and trigger history\n- **Delete alerts**: One-click removal when no longer needed\n\nAlerts trigger via **Telegram instant notifications**, with a **4-hour cooldown** to prevent spam.\n\n> 💡 Use conditions like RSI < 30 or Bias < -20% to let the system watch the market for you.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Track Institutional Moves — Expand \"🐳 Institutional Holdings (13F)\"\n\nEach stock card's \"🐳 Institutional Holdings (13F)\" section provides:\n- **WhaleWisdom link**: One-click access to full 13F institutional holdings report\n- **Top 5 Institutional Holders**: Displayed as a table when available\n- Key observations:\n  - **New / Add** → Institutions are accumulating\n  - **Reduce / Sold Out** → Institutions are exiting\n\n> 💡 Follow \"new positions\", not existing inventory. Watch benchmark institutions like Berkshire, Bridgewater, Renaissance.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Check Earnings & Dividends\n\nEach stock card automatically displays:\n- **📅 Earnings Date**: Next earnings release date, with countdown when within 14 days\n- **💰 Dividend Yield** (Moat/Bond categories): Current dividend yield and ex-dividend date\n\n> 💡 Earnings season is the critical moment when your moat thesis gets validated — prepare in advance.\n\n---\n\n#### Stock Card Information\n\nEach stock card title contains the following:\n\n`⚪ AMZN — 🌊 Trend Setter | $208.72 | 🇺🇸 US`\n\n- **Scan Signal** (🟢🟠🔴⚪) — Latest scan result\n- **Ticker** — e.g., AMZN, 0050.TW\n- **Category** — Trend Setter / Moat / Growth / Bond\n- **Price** — Latest stock price\n- **Market Flag** — 🇺🇸 US / 🇹🇼 TW / 🇯🇵 JP / 🇭🇰 HK (auto-detected from ticker suffix)\n\nWhen expanded, the card footer shows **🕐 Data Updated** time (auto-converted to your browser's local timezone).\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Record Your Thesis — Expand \"📝 Thesis Versioning\"\n\nInvestment decisions need documentation to avoid hindsight bias:\n- Expand \"📝 Thesis Versioning\" to view **complete thesis history** (with version numbers and dates)\n- Each update auto-increments the version (v1 → v2 → v3...)\n- **Tags** (AI, Cloud, SaaS...) are versioned alongside the thesis\n\n> 💡 Regularly review your thesis evolution to discover blind spots and track your growth.\n\n---\n\n#### 8. Manage Watchlist — Sort, Categorize, Export, Import\n\n- **↕️ Drag to Reorder**: Check \"↕️ Drag to Reorder\" at the top of each tab, drag to rearrange, then click \"💾 Save Order\"\n- **🔄 Change Category**: Switch category directly from the stock card (e.g., Trend Setter → Moat)\n- **🗑️ Remove**: Requires a reason — removed stocks appear in the \"📦 Removed\" tab\n- **🔄 Reactivate**: In the \"📦 Removed\" tab, reactivate stocks to any category\n- **📥 Export Watchlist**: Download JSON of your complete watchlist (with thesis and tags) from the left panel\n- **📤 Import Watchlist**: Upload JSON for batch import (supports upsert) from the left panel\n\n---\n\n#### 9. Weekly Digest\n\nEvery Sunday at 18:00 UTC, the system sends a **Telegram portfolio health report** containing:\n- **Health Score**: Percentage of stocks with normal signals (e.g., 85%)\n- **Anomaly List**: Stocks currently not NORMAL and their signals\n- **Weekly Signal Changes**: Stocks with signal changes in the past 7 days and change counts\n\n> 💡 Spend 5 minutes reviewing the weekly digest to stay on top of your portfolio."

The \"⚙️ Settings\" tab has a shared **display currency selector** and **🔄 Refresh** button — switching currency or refreshing applies to all analysis tabs.\n\n#### 📊 Rebalance Analysis\n\n- **Loading Indicator**: Shows \"📊 Loading rebalance analysis...\" animation while loading, auto-collapses to \"✅ Rebalance analysis loaded\"\n- **Data Update Time**: Shows data fetch time (🕐), auto-detects browser timezone for local time display\n- **Live Exchange Rates**: System fetches real-time rates via yfinance (1-hour cache) for accurate cross-currency conversion\n- **Dual Pie Charts**: Target allocation vs actual allocation\n- **Drift Bar Chart**: Deviation per category (red = overweight / green = underweight)\n- **Holdings Detail**: Shows each stock's original currency, quantity, price, cost basis, converted market value, and weight\n- **Rebalance Suggestions**: Auto-flags categories drifting >5%, with add/reduce recommendations\n- **🔬 X-Ray Analysis**: Auto-parses ETF top 10 holdings, calculates \"direct holdings + indirect ETF exposure\" true ratios. Stacked bar chart shows concentration risk; orange warnings at >15% threshold; one-click Telegram alert\n\n> 💡 Periodically (e.g., quarterly) reviewing asset allocation is the most important — yet most neglected — investment discipline.\n\n#### 💱 Currency Exposure Monitor\n\n- **Home Currency Setting**: Switch home currency in the top-right (e.g., TWD → USD) — used as the FX exposure baseline\n- **Dual Tabs**:\n  - **💵 Cash Currency Exposure** (default): Analyzes only cash position currency distribution — FX risk impacts cash most directly\n  - **📊 Full Asset Currency Exposure**: Analyzes entire portfolio (stocks, bonds, cash) currency distribution\n- **Currency Distribution Pie**: Donut chart showing market value proportion per currency\n- **Risk Level**: Auto-determined by FX alert severity\n  - 🟢 Low Risk: No significant FX alerts\n  - 🟡 Medium Risk: Short-term (5-day) swing detected\n  - 🔴 High Risk: Single-day extreme movement detected\n- **Recent FX Changes**: Shows 5-day FX rate change for each foreign currency vs home currency, with 📈📉 direction indicators\n- **FX Alerts**: Three-tier detection (🔴 1-day >1.5% / 🟡 5-day >2% / 🔵 3-month >8%), color-coded\n- **Smart Advice**: System highlights cash position exposure amounts needing attention\n- **Telegram Alerts**: Sent when FX changes exceed thresholds (including cash exposure amounts). Auto-checks every 6 hours; manual trigger via \"📨 Send FX Exposure Alert to Telegram\"\n\n#### 💰 Smart Withdrawal\n\nWhen you need to withdraw cash from your portfolio, the system uses a **Liquidity Waterfall** three-tier priority algorithm to suggest the optimal sell plan:\n\n1. **🔄 Rebalance** (Priority 1): Sell overweight assets first — simultaneously returning to target allocation\n2. **📉 Tax Harvesting** (Priority 2): Sell positions at a loss for Tax-Loss Harvesting\n3. **💧 Liquidity** (Priority 3): Sell by liquidity order (Cash → Bond → Growth → Moat → Trend Setter)\n\n- Enter **withdrawal amount** and **currency**, click \"💰 Calculate Withdrawal Plan\"\n- System shows sell recommendations table (ticker, quantity, amount, reason) and summary metrics (target, sellable total, shortfall)\n- If portfolio value is insufficient, a **shortfall warning** appears\n- Optionally enable \"📡 Send Telegram Notification\" to sync recommendations to Telegram\n\n> 💡 Smart Withdrawal's core principle: sell what should be sold first (overweight), then what saves taxes (losses), and only then tap liquid assets — protecting your compounding core holdings.\n\n#### 🧪 Stress Test\n\nSimulates market crash scenarios to test your portfolio's resilience. Based on linear CAPM model (β values) to estimate expected losses during market downturns.\n\n- **Crash Scenario Slider**: Select market decline (-50% to 0%) to simulate S&P 500-like crashes\n- **Portfolio Weighted Beta**: Overall Beta value (Beta > 1.0 = more volatile than market; Beta < 1.0 = more stable)\n- **Expected Loss Amount**: Shows projected portfolio loss amount and percentage under the scenario\n- **Pain Levels**:\n  - 🟢 Gentle Breeze (< 10% loss)\n  - 🟡 Noticeable Correction (10–20% loss)\n  - 🟠 Significant Damage (20–30% loss)\n  - 🔴 Sleepless Nights (≥ 30% loss)\n- **Holdings Breakdown**: Per-stock expected loss detail, sorted by impact\n- **Smart Advice**: At \"Sleepless Nights\" level, system provides risk management suggestions (review Beta, emergency fund, leverage risk, etc.)\n- **Privacy Mode**: Supports amount masking — only percentages and levels shown\n\n> 💡 Stress testing helps you assess portfolio resilience and understand extreme-scenario risk exposure. Regularly reviewing Beta and expected losses is a key part of risk management.\n\n---\n\n### Telegram Settings (Dual Mode)\n\n- **System Default Bot**: Uses `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env` — no additional setup needed\n- **Custom Bot**: Enter custom Bot Token and Chat ID, toggle \"Use Custom Bot\"\n- With custom bot enabled, all scan notifications, price alerts, and weekly digests go through your custom bot\n- When custom bot is disabled/not set, automatically falls back to system default bot\n- **Test Button**: After saving, click \"📨 Send Test Message\" to verify the setup\n- **Weekly Digest**: Click \"📬 Send Weekly Digest\" to manually trigger the portfolio health report (runs in background, results sent via Telegram)"
