# Folio Reference

## Signal Taxonomy

Folio uses two signal fields per stock:

- **`last_scan_signal`** — persisted from the last full scan (moat + RSI + bias). Returned by `GET /stocks` and `GET /summary`.
- **`computed_signal`** — real-time from live RSI/bias (no moat check). Returned by `GET /stocks/enriched`. Dashboard and radar prefer this, falling back to `last_scan_signal`. `THESIS_BROKEN` always comes from the persisted value (requires moat analysis).

Both fields use the same 9-state cascade. Higher priority (lower P number) trumps lower when multiple conditions apply.

**Category-aware RSI offsets** — applied to all RSI thresholds (buy and sell): Growth +2, Moat +1, Trend_Setter 0, Bond −3, Cash 0.

**MA200 amplifier (Phase 2)** — after the cascade, if `bias_200` is available: upgrade WEAKENING→APPROACHING_BUY or APPROACHING_BUY→CONTRARIAN_BUY when `bias_200 < −15%`; upgrade CAUTION_HIGH→OVERHEATED when `bias_200 > +20%` (asymmetric due to positive market drift).

| Priority | Signal | Icon | Condition (default offset=0) | Meaning |
|----------|--------|------|------------------------------|---------|
| P1 | `THESIS_BROKEN` | 🚨 | Gross margin YoY deteriorated >2pp | Fundamental thesis broken — re-evaluate holding |
| P2 | `DEEP_VALUE` | 💎 | Bias < −20% AND RSI < 35 | Both indicators confirm deep discount — highest-conviction entry |
| P3 | `OVERSOLD` | 📉 | Bias < −20% (RSI ≥ 35) | Extreme price discount; RSI not confirming — watch for confirmation |
| P4 | `CONTRARIAN_BUY` | 🟢 | RSI < 35 AND Bias < 20% | RSI oversold, price not overheated — potential contrarian entry |
| P4.5 | `APPROACHING_BUY` | 🎯 | RSI < 37 AND Bias < −15% | Accumulation zone — approaching buy range; monitor for RSI confirmation |
| P5 | `OVERHEATED` | 🔥 | Bias > 20% AND RSI > 70 | Both overheated — highest-conviction sell warning |
| P6 | `CAUTION_HIGH` | ⚠️ | Bias > 20% OR RSI > 70 | Single indicator elevated — reduce new positions, tighten stops |
| P7 | `WEAKENING` | 🔻 | Bias < −15% AND RSI < 38 | Early weakness — monitor closely |
| P8 | `NORMAL` | ➖ | Everything else | No notable signal |

### Volume Confidence Qualifiers

Appended to Telegram notifications only — do NOT change the signal enum value.

| Qualifier | Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 📈 volume surge | `volume_ratio ≥ 1.5` | Confirms conviction — capitulation selling (buy) or blow-off top (sell) |
| 📉 thin volume | `volume_ratio ≤ 0.5` | Weakens conviction — price moves on low volume are less reliable |

`THESIS_BROKEN` never receives a volume qualifier.

### None Handling

When technical data is unavailable (e.g., Cash category stocks skip yfinance signals):

- RSI = None: P2, P4, P4.5, P6 (RSI part), P7 conditions are skipped
- Bias = None: P2, P3, P4.5, P5, P6 (bias part), P7 conditions are skipped
- `bias_200` = None: Phase 2 MA200 amplifier is skipped entirely
- Both None: only `THESIS_BROKEN` (P1) or `NORMAL` (P8) are reachable

## Market Sentiment

### US — 5-Tier (Trend Setter Breadth)

Determined by the percentage of **Trend Setter** stocks trading below their 60-day MA. Returned by `GET /scan/last` as `market_sentiment.status` and `market_sentiment.below_60ma_pct`. Contextual backdrop only — does NOT gate signal logic.

| % Below 60MA | Sentiment | Icon | Guidance |
|--------------|-----------|------|----------|
| 0–10% | `STRONG_BULLISH` | ☀️ | Nearly all trend setters healthy — strong breadth, full risk-on |
| 10–30% | `BULLISH` | 🌤️ | Mostly healthy — normal accumulation conditions |
| 30–50% | `NEUTRAL` | ⛅ | Mixed breadth — transition zone, be selective |
| 50–70% | `BEARISH` | 🌧️ | Majority weakening — reduce exposure, tighten stops |
| >70% | `STRONG_BEARISH` | ⛈️ | Extreme weakness — defensive posture, cash is king |

### JP — Nikkei Volatility Index (`^JNV`)

Returned as `"JP"` key when user holds `.T` (Japan) tickers alongside the standard `"US"` Fear & Greed composite.

| Nikkei VI | Level | Guidance |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| ≥ 35 | Extreme Fear | JP market panic — contrarian opportunity zone |
| 25–35 | Fear | JP market cautious — selective accumulation |
| 18–25 | Neutral | JP market balanced — normal positioning |
| 14–18 | Greed | JP market confident — watch for overheating |
| < 14 | Extreme Greed | JP market euphoric — reduce exposure |

### TW — TAIEX Realized Volatility (`^TWII`)

Returned as `"TW"` key when user holds `.TW` (Taiwan) tickers. `source` = `"TAIEX Realized Vol"`. Computed as `std(log_returns) × √252 × 100` (20-day annualized). Key is absent when no `.TW` tickers tracked.

| Realized Vol | Level | Guidance |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| > 30% | Extreme Fear | TW market panic — contrarian opportunity zone |
| 22–30% | Fear | TW market cautious — selective accumulation |
| 15–22% | Neutral | TW market balanced — normal positioning |
| 10–15% | Greed | TW market confident — watch for overheating |
| < 10% | Extreme Greed | TW market euphoric — reduce exposure |

- Cash holdings: no price change (same current and previous value)

## Guru 13F Filing Schedule

During 13F filing seasons (February, May, August, November), the cron service automatically calls `POST /gurus/sync` daily. Off-season it runs weekly. Use `POST /gurus/{id}/sync` manually to force a refresh; `"skipped"` means the data is already current.
