# Backend Testing Standards (pytest)

Every feature MUST ship with tests. Bug fixes MUST include regression tests. No untested code in production.

## Test File Structure

Tests live in `backend/tests/` mirroring the source layout. Sub-packages mirror their source counterparts — e.g., `tests/domain/analysis/` for `domain/analysis/`, `tests/application/stock/` for `application/stock/`, `tests/api/routes/` for `api/routes/`, `tests/infrastructure/market_data/` for `infrastructure/market_data/`.

## Test Naming

Use descriptive names: `test_<function>_should_<expected_behavior>`

## AAA Pattern

Every test follows **Arrange / Act / Assert**. See `backend/tests/` for canonical examples.

## Fixtures & conftest.py

- `conftest.py` provides: `TestClient`, in-memory SQLite DB, mock yfinance data, mock Telegram sender.
- Use `@pytest.fixture` with appropriate scope (`session` for DB, `function` for per-test isolation).

## Mock External Services

- **yfinance**, **Telegram Bot API**, and any network I/O MUST be mocked. Never hit real APIs in tests.
- Use `unittest.mock.patch` or `pytest-mock` to replace infrastructure adapters.
- **Patch at the actual module**, not a re-export shim. Private symbols (e.g., `_fetch_signals_from_yf`) must be patched at their definition site: `infrastructure.market_data.market_data._fetch_signals_from_yf`, not `infrastructure.market_data._fetch_signals_from_yf`.

## Minimum Test Coverage Per Endpoint

| Scenario | Status Code |
|----------|-------------|
| Happy path | 200 / 201 |
| Validation error | 422 |
| Not found | 404 |
| Conflict / duplicate | 409 (where applicable) |

## Webhook Action Coverage

- Every webhook action MUST have at least **one happy-path test** and **one error-path test**.
- The `help` action must be tested to ensure discoverability stays accurate.

## Architecture Boundary Tests

Architecture boundary tests in `backend/tests/test_architecture.py` enforce layer dependency rules using Python's AST module:

- **Domain** must not import from `application`, `infrastructure`, or `api`.
- **Infrastructure** must not import from `application` or `api`.
- **API routes** (`api/routes/`) may only import from `infrastructure.database` (for `get_session`); all other `infrastructure.*` imports are forbidden — including `infrastructure.persistence.*`, `infrastructure.market_data.*`, and `infrastructure.external.*`.

Any new module must not violate the allowed import directions. Run `make test` to verify boundaries have not regressed.
