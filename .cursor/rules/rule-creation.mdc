# Rule Creation Guidelines

## File Naming & Structure

- Use **kebab-case** (e.g., `coding-standards.mdc`, `python-tooling.mdc`)
- Extensions: `.mdc` for rules with YAML frontmatter

## Frontmatter (Required)

```yaml
---
description: "Clear description of what the rule covers and when it applies"
globs: ""  # or ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
alwaysApply: false  # or true
---
```

## Activation Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Always Apply** (`alwaysApply: true`) | Universal project standards | Keep minimal (1-2 rules max) |
| **Auto Attached** (`globs: ["backend/**"]`) | Language/directory/file-type specific | Most rules should use this |
| **Agent Requested** (description-based) | Situational rules AI can determine | Description states WHEN to apply |
| **Manual** (@-mention) | Infrequently used, checklists | User explicitly references |

## Content Best Practices

- **Reference files, don't copy contents**: Point to canonical examples (e.g., "See `backend/api/stock_routes.py`") instead of duplicating code
- **One topic per file**: Split when > 500 lines or serving distinct contexts
- **Include examples**: Show ✅ GOOD and ❌ BAD patterns
- **Target 50-200 lines**: Keep focused

## When to Create a New Rule

✅ Create when: New tech added, repeated mistakes, new architectural pattern
❌ Don't create for: One-off edge cases, obvious guidance, framework features AI knows
