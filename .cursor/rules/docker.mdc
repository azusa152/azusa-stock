# Docker Best Practices

## Non-root Execution
- **Non-root execution:** All containers run as the `folio` user. Never run application processes as root.

## Entrypoint Pattern
- **Entrypoint pattern:** Services with persistent volumes MUST use a `docker-entrypoint.sh` script that:
  1. Runs initially as root to fix volume ownership (`chown -R folio:folio /app/data`)
  2. Drops privileges via `gosu folio` before exec'ing the main process
  3. Is idempotent (safe to run on every startup)

## Privilege Dropping
- **gosu for privilege drop:** Use `gosu` (not `su` or `sudo`) for dropping privileges in entrypoint scripts. Install via `apt-get install gosu`.

## Image Security
- **Image pinning:** Pin base images with SHA256 digest. Update periodically.
- **No USER directive with volumes:** Do not use `USER` in Dockerfiles that mount persistent volumes. Use the entrypoint pattern instead.
